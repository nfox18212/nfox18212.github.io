# Division of Labor

Nathan Fox did almost everything.  Git logs are availible to prove this.  Sebastien worked on one file, which was display.s, and some documentation for that one file.  He started seriosuly writing code on Thursday, April 25th.  Two days before the deadline.

This was after pressure from Nate to commit his code, talking about implementations and even going to lab with him.  He still did not write code.  As of April 12th, he admitted he hadn't written any code.  As far as I can tell due to the stark lack of commits, this held true until Thursday.

On Friday, April 26th.  Date of the deadline.  He pushed his code and it did not work.  I personally was helping debug since I had nothing else to do, my job was done.  Sebastien's code in display.s was faulting and we were not able to fix this issue in time.  Generally due to his lack of work.

Sebastien did help with ideas.  But ideas are not code.  And what was needed was code.

To summarize, if the code was written in a file that is not display.s Nathan Fox wrote it.  If it is in display.s, Sebastien wrote it.
